# Cull Particles

## Features

This mod prevents the rendering of particles which the player cannot see. This can drastically improve performance when in scenarios where there are many particles near the player such as modern servers.

## History

This is an updated and altered version of an abandoned mod which can be found [here](https://github.com/Tfarcenim/CullParticlesFabric). This version will receive regular updates for new Minecraft versions and has been improved for compatibility.
